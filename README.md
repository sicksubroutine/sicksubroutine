### Greetings and Salutations!

You have found me in such a weird place! Funny how these things happen, am I right? 

The best place to find out more about me is *[muh website](https://sicksubroutine.com).*

As of Nov 2023, I'm currently focusing primarily on game dev. Most of my current work is on graphics programming within Pyton/Pygame with some other practice in C/C++ and Lua/Pico 8.

Current project: 3D Engine/Raycasting Engine and a grid based Map Editor that works in both.

As of April 2023: My current primary focus is Python/Flask with some practice in JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Long term goals still revolve around game dev but becoming a more comptent programmer is the short term goal. Medium term goals involve getting better at C based languages and making my third game.
