### Greetings and Salutations!

You have found me in such a weird place! Funny how these things happen, am I right? 

The best place to find out more about me is *[muh website](https://sicksubroutine.com).*

As of Jan 2023: My current primary focus is Python/Flask with some practice in JavaScript/HTML/CSS. Long term goals still revolve around game dev but becoming a more comptent programmer is the short term goal. Meditum term goals involve getting better at C based languages and making my third game.
